# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting Details

Create an environment file `.env` and put `PORT=8000` into it.

### Do `yarn`

### Then `yarn start` to start the project

## Suggested improvements to this project

#### Due to limited of time, I could not implement a set of features on the front end.

1. Adding React Proptypes
2. Adding Styled Components for proper styling (also using betterUI).
3. Adding proper error handling.
4. Adding proper linting to lint the project.
